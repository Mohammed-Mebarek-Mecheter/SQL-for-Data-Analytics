    "This report provides an analysis of payment methods used for making orders and their impact on total revenue based on the provided dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "The Payment Method Insights aim to understand the distribution of payment methods used by customers and analyze how payment fees impact total revenue. By examining payment methods and their associated fees, businesses can optimize payment processing strategies to minimize fees and maximize revenue.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Findings\n",
    "\n",
    "### Most Commonly Used Payment Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on the dataset, the most commonly used payment methods for making orders are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Credit Card**: 659 orders\n",
    "2. **Transfer**: 225 orders\n",
    "3. **Cash**: 116 orders\n",
    "\n",
    "These findings provide insights into the distribution of payment methods used by customers, with credit card being the most preferred method followed by transfer and cash.\n",

    "- Credit card payments have higher payment fees compared to Transfer payments, resulting in slightly lower revenue after deducting payment fees.\n",

    "- Cash payments have no payment fees associated, resulting in the same total revenue as revenue after deducting payment fees.\n",

    "### Optimization Strategies\n",
    "\n",
    "- Encouraging the use of payment methods with lower fees, such as Transfer, can help minimize payment fees and maximize revenue.\n",
    "- Negotiating lower payment processing fees or exploring alternative payment processing solutions can also reduce overall payment costs and increase revenue.\n",
    "- Offering incentives or discounts for customers who use payment methods with lower fees can help drive adoption and optimize payment methods further."
