# International Debt Analysis Project

## Project Description

In this project, we analyze international debt data collected by The World Bank. The dataset contains information about the amount of debt (in USD) owed by developing countries across several categories. The primary goal is to answer various questions related to the debt owed by these countries and to identify patterns and trends in the data.

## Dataset Description

The dataset contains the following columns:

- `country_name`: Name of the country
- `country_code`: Code representing the country
- `indicator_name`: Description of the debt indicator
- `indicator_code`: Code representing the debt indicator
- `debt`: Value of the debt indicator for the given country (in current US dollars)

## Project Goals

1. **Overall Debt Analysis**
   - What is the total debt owed by developing countries?
   - Which countries have the highest and lowest total debt?
   - What are the top debt indicators by total debt?

2. **Country-Specific Analysis**
   - How does the distribution of debt vary among different countries?
   - What are the top 10 countries with the highest and lowest total debt?

3. **Debt Category Analysis**
   - What are the top debt indicators for each country?
   - Which indicators have the highest average debt values?

4. **Debt Sustainability Analysis**
   - Are there countries at risk of debt distress or default?
   - Calculate Debt-to-GDP Ratio, Debt Service Ratio, and External Debt to Exports Ratio for each country.

5. **Regional Analysis**
   - Which regions have the highest and lowest total debt?
   - How does debt distribution vary by region and indicator?

## Conclusion

This project provides a comprehensive analysis of international debt data, identifying key patterns and trends in debt across various countries and indicators. By answering specific questions and visualizing the data, we can gain valuable insights into the debt landscape and make informed decisions.
